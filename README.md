# Tyrian â€¢ [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com)

> Tyrian is an Elm-inspired, purely functional web framework for Scala 3. Its purpose is to make building interactive websites in Scala 3 fun! Tyrian allows you to describe web pages and complex interactions in a way that is elegant, easy to read and easy to reason about.

This is an implementation of the standard TodoMVC project using Tyrian, which acts as a rosetta stone for most common JavaScript frameworks.

You can see it running [here](https://purplekingdomgames.github.io/tyrian-todo/).

## Implementation

This project was built using the official TodoMVC [template](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc-app-template) and [specification](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/blob/master/app-spec.md), and is based on the standard `tyrian.g8` project. To begin your own project the same way, enter the following on your command line:

`sbt new PurpleKingdomGames/tyrian.g8`

## Performance

I've set up the performance test runner just for some idea of a speed comparison. I personally don't put too much stock in it as the test scenario is very artifical, but it is fun.

Two caveats:

1. Please note that the comparisons being made are against the other frameworks the runner was bundled with, which are all a good few versions out of date. I didn't make the runner and have no easy way to update them.
2. Performance seems to be quite system sensitive. So again, while it's a fun test, I wouldn't read more into the results than "we're all in the same ball park."

> Note: This image was captured against an older version. The test runner for some of the frameworks here seem to have rotted and don't run now. However, the performance of Tyrian 0.7.0 seems to be approximately the same, but is much more stable and enjoys significantly faster start up times.

## Running Locally

To run the program in a browser you will need to have yarn (or npm) installed.

Before your first run and for your tests to work, **you must** install the node dependencies with:

```sh
yarn install
```

This example uses Parcel.js as our bundler and dev server, there are lots of other options you might prefer like Webpack, scalajs-bunder, or even just vanilla JavaScript.

We recommend you have two terminal tabs open in the directory containing this README file.

In the first, we'll run sbt.

```sh
sbt
```

From now on, we can recompile the app with `fastOptJS` or `fullOptJS` _**but please note** that the `tyrianapp.js` file in the root is expecting the output from `fastOptJS`_.

Run `fastOptJS` now to get an initial build in place.

Then start your dev server, with:

```sh
yarn start
```

Now navigate to [http://localhost:1234/](http://localhost:1234/) to see your site running.

If you leave parcel's dev server running, all you have to do is another `fastOptJS` or `fullOptJS` and your app running in the browser should hot-reload the new code.
